network vulnerability
hascat tool - bruteforce  it is used for password cracking tool, attacks RAT(remote access troject)
securing resource, safegaurding one type is physical control , logical control and the third one is administrative control  
port scanning 
protocol means set of rules like tcp and udp in networks 65535 tcp ports 65535 udp ports are there. tcp is maximum usable one by using these ports all the ones are communicate.
tcp
the browser https is work on 443 port
  http is work on 80th port wich is unsafe.
  diff b/w http and https
block chain
block chain security

what hacking
gaining unauthorized access
what ethical hacking
gaining unauthorized access with return permission

  website,webpage,webserver,webapplication
  webapplication = where user use the web called webapplication
collection of web called website

two fields 
affense and defense called red and blue team.both mingled is called purple team.
defense is a soc analysist.
three types of hackers 
white,black,grey hat
architecture 
zero knowledge about the tools and they hack called black hat hackers
both white and black are grey hat hackers

CIA tired
CIA=confidentiality,integrity,availability
confidentiality

authentication - verify someone identity
authorization or access control - getting permission

authentication is consider by 3factors
1.something you know by your own
2.something you have like aadhar number,otp,pan card.
3.something you are like biometric,physical characteristics(left-handed)
if we are using any two factor in the above three it is called 2factor authentication

authorization it means getting permission like installing software in lap we give permission

intrgrity
it means orginality

conversion of clear text to cipher text is called encryption

breach - loss of control
event - observable occurence in a network
bug - deviation from a actual recquirement
incident - which affect the cia is called incident
intuusion - security event called intrusion
threat - 
risk - threat + vulnerability
TOE - target of evaluation or targeting the ip address

IPV4
192.168.1.0 to 192.168.1.255 ->256 ips are there
192.168.1.1/24 - 32bit-decimal (0-9)
11000000.10101000.0000001.00000001

IPv6
128bit-hexadecimal-(0-9 & A-F)

MYSQL use - 
local host work on port 80.

windows works on
1..exe file
2.batfile

use in cmd prompt            `
in windows while using the pink (ip address of who u attack)-n 4 it will transfer 4 packet as default
but in linux we need to determine the count pink (ip address of who u attack)-c 4

to find the ip address of some website use ping and copy the address bar of the website and remove the http://www.& last remove/
C:\Users\WELCOME>ping camsmkce.in

network 

1 use the cross over wire to connect the same devices
2 straight through is used for connecting different devices
3 to connect the two router use the serial cable

proxy
  

vpn - it encrypit the cnnection
---vpn-----    => security reason
client server communication 
---vpn-----

encryption -> clear text to ciper
decryption -> ciper to clear text

symmetric -> use single key
Asymmetric -> use public and private key

whireshark
ip.addr==ip address

three way hand shake  -> occur in tcp protocol
data transfer
client ack to sender
sender ack to client that ack has receiverd.

tls(transport layer security) hand shake
